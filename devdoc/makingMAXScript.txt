Folders "src\MetaMaxScript" and "src\MetaGMaxScript" contain header files 
which implement project functionality in the MAXScript language. 
These files not intended to be compiled with C++ compiler,
instead of this they must be processed with WAVE and SED. 
WAVE will replace all C++ macroses with their values and 
SED will make some additional processing.

Special cases:
HASH - this word used in the code and means a single character #
It's used because writing the '#' character directly in the code will confuse WAVE
because WAVE treats '#' as a start of preprocessor directive. 
SED is used to replace the "HASH" word with the '#' character.
