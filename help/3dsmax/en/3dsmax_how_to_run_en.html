<h3>How to run the plugins</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> After installation you will have two different variants of the "KrxImpExp" plugins. The first variant is a set of normal import and export plugins for 3ds max which were written in C++ with the "3ds max SDK" library. These plugins can be started with items "File->Import" and "File->Export" of the main menu. The second variant is a set of scripts in the MAXScript language. These scripts can be started from a new window named "KrxImpExp" in the "Utilities" panel. The first variant works faster (C++ is faster than MAXScript), and the second variant gives you freedom of choice. <br>

<p><b>2.</b> Select proper file types in the file import and file export dialogs. There are two supported file types: "Kerrax 3D Studio Meshes (*.3DS)" and "Kerrax ASCII Models (*.ASC)". <br>
